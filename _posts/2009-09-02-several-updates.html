<p>Well, the 8th of January looks so far.  That was the last time I wrote!</p>

<p>In fact, I hadn't a lot of spare time, and I'm getting involved in some
uba-spiff stuff.  In the work, I'm improving my C/C++ skills, and I spend some
time writting some Ruby and Python (and looking a bit to IronPython too) code
too :)  I'm also getting involved with <a href="http://www.agile-spain.com">Agile Spain Community</a> where I've found some cool colleagues.</p>

<p>Sadly, I haven't enough spare time to spend with my contributions to <a href="http://www.mono-project.com">Mono Project</a>, but I'd like to show some stuff.  I started a <a href="http://gitorious.org/gendarme-templates-for-monodevelop">repo</a> in <a href="http://www.gitorious.org">Gitorious</a> with some MonoDevelop templates for developing rules for Gendarme (it's in a really alpha state
!!).</p>

<p> I hope find more spare time in order to continue contributing, and writting
several new posts :P  And I'm thinking about creating a twitter account </p>
