<h1>This is the status report for June 24 - June 30.</h1>

<h2>Accomplished this week.</h2>

<p>This week I have written a little patch for allow try / catch blocks in the Cecil.FlowAnalysis assembly.  I have sent the patch to the <a href="http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-devel-list/2007-June/023940.html">mono-devel list</a>, because I would like know if I'm doing the testcases correctly and separating the blocks well.</p>

<h2>Plans for the next week.</h2>

<p>I have seen other way for implement this funcionality, because I have read
about the Exception Handling in the Ecma document for CLI, and I can get a
better implementation.  I would like finish this task on Tuesday, because I'm
spending more time in this task and I am a bit delayed.  I will put all effort
in finish it.</p>

<h2>Challenges or Problems.</h2>

<p>This week I haven't a lot of problems, only one; because I don't know where
send the patch.  But Sebastien answered my question quite well.</p>

<h2>Interesting resources.</h2>

<p>Yes, the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm">Ecma-335 document</a> helped me a lot.</p>
