<p>Well, since the Pencils Down Report for the Summer of Code I haven't written
anything about Gendarme.  I have continued contributing, as I wished, and
there's time for write a bit about the progress.</p>

<p>The rules for my GSoC has been merged, and there are more improvements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Install Gendarme.Framework.dll to be reusable with new runners and pkg-config.</li>
<li>Support inclusion and exclusion of rules.</li>
<li>Added a new profile.</li>
</ul>

<p>Step by step, the first feature allows developers to compile their runners
with the -pkg:gendarme-framework modifiers to [g]mcs.</p>

<p>The second one, allows users to create their custom rulesets and adapt the
existing ones to their needs.  By example:  Imagine a company that uses Gendarme
to check their code.  Then they can choose the rules that they apply.  </p>

<p>If, by example, you like check the CodeDuplicatedInSameClass smell and
AvoidLongMethods smell, but you doesn't like apply the
AvoidSpeculativeGenerality you could do it simply:</p>

{% highlight xml %}
<ruleset name="custom">
    <include="CodeDuplicatedInSameClassRule | AvoidLongMethodsRule" from="Gendarme.Rules.Smells.dll"/>
</ruleset>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>And the third one, is the Mono BCL profile.  This profile is intended to use
with applications or libraries where the public API isn't under our control, by
example Mono.</p>
