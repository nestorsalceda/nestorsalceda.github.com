<h1>This is the status report for June 4 - June 10.</h1>

<h2> Accomplished this week.</h2>

<p>I have proposed 2 new rules.  This rules deals with enums; the first rule,
was "Do use a singular name for an enumeration, unless its values are bit
fields".  The second one, was "Do use a plural name for the Flags Enums".</p>

<p>I have to write a fix for the singular and singular checkings.</p>

<h2>Plans for the next week.</h2>

<p>The next week, I will purpose a new rule for check the empty catch statements
and start working with Cecil and IL.</p>

<p>I also would like start the code duplicate smell.</p>

<h2>Challenges or problems.</h2>

<p>This last week, I was really busy.  This week, I will write more code.</p>

<h2>Interesting resources.</h2>
