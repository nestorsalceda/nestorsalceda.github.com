<p>I'm not used to write about me in my blog, but this time is different.</p>

<p>My life is gonna to change now.  Several months ago, I decided to decrease my
study time, and start working, perhaps change the place where I used to live in.
Now it's the time.</p>

<p>After looking for a job quietly, I've found a job in a <a href="http://www.taric.es">company</a> (or <a href="http://www.abstra.cc">two</a>) which looks really nice, and today
I've received the last instructions.  I will start the 19th of January.  I never
am scared about the changes, nor this time that accept the job implies move my
living place to Madrid.</p>

<p>I feel I'm going to start a new chapter in my own book, a new life, new
challenges, new colleagues, new place, new job...  But I'm proud of myself,
because I was a bit disgusted with my studies (be careful, I'll continue
studying in the university, although it's a bit boring :P) and I decided change
that; and I can say (in this moment) I have achieved it, and I'm excited and
really happy.</p>

<p>However, I start a new chapter; it will contain a lot of references to the
previous one.  I will continue my university studies (my second degree), I will
continue contributing with <a href="http://www.mono-project.com">Mono</a>,  I
will come back to visit my famliy and I continue keeping the relationships with
my dear friends and colleagues.</p>

<p>Perhaps a bit philosophical phrase could be:</p>

<blockquote>
The past escaped you can't do anything for that, it reflects your present.  But won't exist the future if you are walking backwards.
</blockquote>
<p>
Just listen to the wind ...
