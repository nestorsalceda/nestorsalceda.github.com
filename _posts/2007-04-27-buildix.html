<p>Some days before my travel to Valencia, I have seen this amazing tool.</p>

<p><a href="http://buildix.thoughtworks.com/">Buildix</a> is a GNU/Linux
distribution that combines some tools:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net">CruiseControl</a></li>
<li><a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And all of them with an little apache front end for manage users for all
components.  I have seen the demo and I decided to try it.</p>

<p>I'm using trac for my projects and subversion, I think that it's a great
combination.  Trac forces you to think for tickets, you could think tickets as
little things that add value and for register bugs too.  Then you can only
concentrate in these tickets and no write more extra code that doesn't add any
value.</p>

<p>Then, the subversion server allows you to drop code ownership; and in a
little time you could share your changes and patches.  And one interesting thing
about trac and subversion, the hooks.  With the hooks, you can write in your svn
message:</p>

{% highlight text %}
refs #ticketNumber

Stuff, Foo, Bar ...
{% endhighlight %}

<p>And then, you can go to the ticket URL in trac and see this changes as
comments, with this little things you can concentrate about the value.  You also
can close a ticket.</p>

<p>The only thing that I don't know is CruiseControl, is for create automated
building and test the application (also pass a pretty printer for code), by this
time I have only seen working with Java.  I have seen CruiseControl for .NET.  I
don't know if there are any platform for get continous integration in a more
generic way, for example: For Java, you can use Maven, or Ant or Makefiles too,
for Mono you can use NMaven, NAnt and makefiles too.  I believe that one tool
that be capable to build the entire project in an heterogeneus scenario, for
example: If you are developing a C# application and build with NAnt, the tool
take care of this and use NAnt for compile.  The same, if you are writing a Java
application.  The same if you are writing a C/C++application, using
Makefiles.</p>

<p>I think we can abstract this component a bit more and get a more generic
builder, with different backends.</p>

<p>And the last one idea for today, I have think about a distribution for
developers.  For example, the ubuntu people has the Sun Toolchain for write Java
applications.  Or the Mono VMWare images for test.  Every developer write the
code in a different way, but for example a distribution with libraries (log4net,
nmock, nunit, mono, monodevelop ...)  Or in the Java way a distro including
(log4java, netbeans or eclipse, java, tomcat, jboss...)</p>

<p>And that's all for today.</p>
