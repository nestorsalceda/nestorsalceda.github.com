<h2>Accomplished this week.</h2>

<p>This week, I have learnt some stuff more about Gendarme and Cecil. I have
learnt the differences about TypeReference and TypeDefinition, and how Cecil
resolves the assemblies.</p>

<p>I also learnt about Gendarme framework, I have looked the source code, and I
have understand better how gendarme applies the rules.</p>

<h2>Plans for the next week.</h2>

<p>For the next week, I want finish some simple tasks, 2 or 3 or 4 anyways.  And
if I have finished these tasks I would like start with the smells.</p>

<p>The first smell will be the duplicated code.  Then, I will learn more about
Mono.Cecil.Cil namespace.</p>

<h2>Challenges or problems.</h2>

<p>The first problem came up with the TypeReference and TypeDefinition
difference.  Sebastien helped me a lot, because he explained the differences and
the problems quite good.</p>

<h2>Interesting resources.</h2>

<p>I have this <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/kcwalina/archive/2004/05/18/134208.aspx#135297">link</a> that it's a really interesting lecture about enums, and in general about coding guidelines.</p>
