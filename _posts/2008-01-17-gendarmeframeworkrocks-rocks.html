<p> In the Mono Summit the Gendarme Team discussed about the features for the next version.  We have a lot of new ideas for improve the framework.  The main targets, for the framework, are the following:<p>
<ul>
	<li>Make simpler write rules, and easier to understand.</li>
	<li>Make rules uniform, reduce code duplication, easy testing.</li>
</ul>

<p>These topics are a bit abstract and is a hard task get it completed.  But I
believe this is the first step for achieve these topics.</p>

<p>The main problem when we are writting new rules, is the code duplication.
There are several things we should prepare before write the rule logic.  By
example, when a rule is applied?  We have a lot of scenarios before appliying
the rule, if the method is anonymous doesn't make sense check about the naming
conventions, or if a rule must check only the setters.  And is always the same
code, repeated one time, other time, another time ... </p>

<p>It's easy to understand that this code should be extracted to other class
but, where should we put this code?  The first impression was create static
helpers classes, then you can get this code in the rules:</p>

{% highlight csharp %}
public MessageCollection CheckMethod (...)
{
    if (!MethodHelpers.IsSetter (method))
        return runner.RuleSuccess;
    //Imagine more rule logic
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>It's okey, but if we use static classes with static methods and thinking a bit ... Eureka! We can use extension methods to Cecil types, following the <a href="http://evain.net/blog/">JB's</a> <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Rocks">Mono.Rocks</a>, and the rules looks like:</p>

{% highlight csharp %}
public MessageCollection CheckMethod (...)
{
    if (!method.IsSetter ())
        return runner.RuleSuccess;
    //Imagine more rule logic
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Beautiful code, isn't it?</p>

<p>Then, <a href="http://pages.infinit.net/ctech/poupou.html">Sebastien</a> and
GHOP participants (Daniel Abramov, Adrian Tsai and Andreas Noever) implemented
some of these Rocks (Good work guys !).  The Rocks have unit tests and
documentation, and we can use it for concentrate our effort writting more
complete rules (click the image for a bigger size).</p>

<p>Finally, as all people loves screenshots, this is one screenshot of Monodoc
showing the rocks documentation:</p>
