<h1>This is the status report for July 30 - August 5.</h1>

<h2>Accomplished this week.</h2>

<p>Well, after the review process, <a href="http://monotorrent.blogspot.com/">Alan</a> suggested me that 10 is a big number for a long parameter list.  <a href="http://gameweld-soc.blogspot.com/">Chris</a> also suggested me if there are any way for change values for the rules without recompile.</p>

<p>Then I presented a solution and I wrote a patch for allow put some parameter
in the gendarme file config.  Then, with the patch you can specify some
parameters for each ruleset, I like the results and the patch is pending for
review.</p>

<p>I also finished the Avoid Unused Parameters rule.  <a href="http://monotorrent.blogspot.com/">Alan</a> suggested this rule in the list, and I liked it.  This is because, sometimes, refactoring and removing some parameters, accidentally, I forgot remove the parameter from the method signature.  This rule will check that you use all parameters in the signature.</p>

<h2>Plans for the next week.</h2>

<p>Well, for the next week I have some ideas.  The first will be implement the
message chain smell.  This smell happens when you make a lot of chained calls.
By example:</p>

{% highlight csharp %}
Foo anObject = new Foo ();
anObject.Bar.ApplyBaz (otherObject).MakeStuff ().Handle ().ToBar ();
{% endhighlight %}

<p>There are a lot of calls in this line, and you can read more about it in this
<a href="http://www.soberit.hut.fi/mmantyla/BadCodeSmellsTaxonomy.htm">link</a>.
Chris has written some code for detect this chains, and I can reuse it.</p>

<p>There are other options, by example Detect long classes.  This smell a bit
complex to detect, but I believe I can do it.  And with this smell, I have
finished my 4 comples smells, and I can continue with others (Shotgun surgery,
feature envy ...)</p>

<h2>Challenges or Problems.</h2>

<p>Nothing special, there was a problem detecting unused parameters.  Specially
with static methods, but I have fixed it and the rule will be reviewed.</p>

<p>Other challenge was, read, understand and modify the gendarme code; but the
code is really clear and I like it.  I really enjoyed a lot writting the
patch.</p>

<h2>Interesting resources.</h2>

<p>Well, I have written a link some lines before.  You can check it <a href="http://www.soberit.hut.fi/mmantyla/BadCodeSmellsTaxonomy.htm">here</a> is another taxonomy for bad smells.</p>

<p>Finally I want thank, all people that helped me, with ideas, with revisions or with other help.  Specially my mentor, <a href="http://pages.infinit.net/ctech/poupou.html">Sebastien</a>, and <a href="http://monotorrent.blogspot.com/">Alan</a>, and <a href="http://gameweld-soc.blogspot.com/">Chris</a> and <a href="http://evain.net/blog/">JB Evain</a> for the corrections and advices in the IRC.</p>
