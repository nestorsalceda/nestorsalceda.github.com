<h1>This is the status report for August 12 - August 17.</h1>

<h2>Accomplished this week.</h2>

<p>Following the Sebastien's wish, I have implemented the Avoid Speculative
Generality Rule, the rule is now for the reviewing process.  This rule is a
large rule, because I should check several things.</p>

<p>The rule will check for abstract classes without responsability, unnecesary
delegation and I have a small solution for the problem with the duplicated
violations.  I'm going to explain the problem, for example, in the speculative
generality smell, I have some signs for detect this smell, one of them is that
exists methods with unused parameters (generally reserved parameters), then some
weeks ago, I wrote a rule for detect the unused parameters, then I will run
gendarme and I can get 2 errors:</p>

<ol>
<li>The error produced by Avoid Speculative Generality Rule.</li>
<li>The error produced by the Avoid Unused Parameters Rule.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then, when a detect a fail, the message should be clear and you should find
the error quickly.  If you get 2 messages, produced by the same error you can
get confused with the errors.</p>

<p>Then, in the CheckType signature I get a TypeDefinition and a Runner.  The
runner contains a property for retrieve the rules applied, then I checked if the
AvoidUnusedParameters rule will be executed (or has been executed), and if the
rule is present I will skip the checking in the Avoid Speculative Generality
rule.</p>

<h2>Plans for the next week.</h2>

<p>Sadly,  the Summer of Code starts to end.  I should upload the code, but I
have a little bit of time for writting the next rule, I have posted the
specification for the Avoid Code Duplicated In Sibling Classes.  As I wrote
other rule for check the code duplicated, I only should refactor and get the
rule.</p>

<h2>Challenges or problems.</h2>

<p>Nothing special, the problem of the violations has been (half) fixed.</p>

<h2>Interesting resource.</h2>

<p>This week, I haven't any interesting resource.</p>

<p>Finally I want thank Sebastien, for give me advices and recomendations.</p>
