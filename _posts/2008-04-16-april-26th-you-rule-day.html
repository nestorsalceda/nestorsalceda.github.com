<p>The Gendarme team is proud to announce the first edition of the Gendarme Rule Day.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you have a nice idea for a rule which you'd like to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/gendarme/web/how-to-write-cool-rules">write</a> or discuss.</li>
<li>Or if you <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/gendarme/web/rules">don't have a specific idea</a> but you'd like to try Gendarme and write a new rule.</li>
<li>Or if you'd like improve an existing rule.</li>
<li>Or if you want to learn more about Gendarme ecosystem or Gendarme developer's and fans ... </li>
</ul>

<p>Please join us April 26th in the #gendarme IRC channel (in irc.gimp.org) for
an interactive, collaborative and intense rule writing effort.</p>

<p>We will be there with you!</p>
