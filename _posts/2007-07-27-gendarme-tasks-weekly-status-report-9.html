<p>This is the status report for July 20 - July 27.</p>

<h2>Accomplished this week.</h2>

<p>This week I have been hunting a bug in the measurement tool.  I have written
some tests and I have detected and fixed it.</p>

<p>I also take some measures for choose the long parameter list, and I have
decided to use 10 as MaxParameters in the rule.  Personally, I prefer shorter
parameter lists, but for the rule I believe that is a good measure.</p>

<p>I have sent the rules for the review process.</p>

<h2>Plans for the next week.</h2>

<p>For the next week, I will propose new rules.  I like the Alan proposal for
detect unused parameters.  And I would like implement it.</p>

<p>As this rule is simple, I will propose a new rule for a new smell.</p>

<h2>Challenges or problems.</h2>

<p>None, this week I have worked in the tool; and I have detected the bugs and
corrected it.</p>

<h2>Interesting resources.</h2>

<p>Well, I will post a <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Team/FxCop/gotdotnetstyle.aspx?url=FxCop.html">link</a> for the FxCorp tool.  There are a lot of useful rules.</p>

<p>Finally, thank to all people that has commented the rules and suggest me some
features and new rules.</p>
