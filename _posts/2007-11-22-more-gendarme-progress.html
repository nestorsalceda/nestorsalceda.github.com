<p>Since the last post talking about the project files for MonoDevelop, there
are some progress that should be mentioned:</p>

<ul>
	<li>All rules are fully documented.  You can see it in <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Gendarme">Gendarme Main Page</a> and in <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/gendarme/web/rules-documentation">Gendarme Google Group</a></li>
	<li>We have fixed some bugs in the rules.</li>
        <li>Added the Moonlight profile.</li>
</ul>

<p>And the next week is the <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/MonoSummit2007">Mono Summit 2007</a>.  I'm really excited, because I have the chance to meet face of face to all the Mono Team (and my Gendarme colleagues), I can talk with them, I can learn a lot of things from them,  improve and perhaps hack together.</p>
