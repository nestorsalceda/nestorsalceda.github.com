<p>Yesterday night, before a week without any free time, I decided spent some
time on Gendarme.</p>

<p>I decided spent some time on integration tasks with others applications (NAnt, XBuild, CC.NET ...) You can read the <a href=" http://groups.google.com/group/gendarme/browse_thread/thread/81384cc9adc8ef9d">thread</a> on <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/Gendarme">Gendarme Google Group</a>.  And I started writting a Gendarme Task for <a href="http://nant.sourceforge.net">NAnt</a>.</p>

<p>By the moment, as I can't capture all in an screenshot, you can see it in
action in a screencast:</p>

</div>


<p>Note that it's only a prototype, and is under heavy development and it's far
away to be a usable stuff (by the moment).</p>
