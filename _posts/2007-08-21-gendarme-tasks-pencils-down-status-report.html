<p>Sadly, the Summer of Code 2007 has (quasi) finished.  This is the time for
fill the surveys and check the code.</p>

<p>Personally I have enjoyed a lot contributing with this project and I would
like continue contributing with this project, there are some work to do and a
lot of rules for implement and I would like continue working in this area.</p>

<p>A briefly summary of my contributions:</p>

<ul>
<li>A rule for don't swallow errors catching non-specific exceptions.</li>
<li>A rule for check that Attributes end with Attribute suffix.</li>
<li>A rule for check that enums doesn't end with enum or flags suffix.</li>
<li>A rule for check that a enum flags uses a plural name.</li>
<li>A rule for check that a enum uses a singular name unless are flags rule.</li>
<li>A rule for check for unused parameters.</li>
<li>Two rule for check that doesn't exist code duplicated.</li>
<li>A rule for check the class length.</li>
<li>A rule for check the methods length.</li>
<li>A rule for check long parameters list.</li>
<li>A rule for check the presence of speculative generality.</li>
<li>A little gui for a cecil based tool for count and get some numbers for the classes: Number of methods, number of fields, number of lines per method ...</li>
<li>A patch for gendarme for allow set properties in the rules.xml file.</li>
<li>A little patch for Cecil.FlowAnalysis for allow try - catch -finally blocks in the flow analysis.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, I have learnt a lot of stuff:  I have learnt about FOSS projects, how
these projects works, I have learnt about Cecil and Gendarme, I have learnt C#
and CIL, it's amazing.</p>

<p>I want thank all people that helped me, specially <a href="http://pages.infinit.net/ctech/poupou.html">Sebastien</a>, my mentor, for his patience everyday, his coding lessons, his help, his comments ... I also want thank all people that has helped me, <a href="http://monotorrent.blogspot.com/">Alan</a>, <a href="http://gameweld-soc.blogspot.com/">Chris</a>, <a href="http://evain.net/blog/">JB Evain</a>, and my colleagues working on more Gendarme stuff, Nidhi and Lukasz.  And I'm sure that I will forget some names, please apologize me.  Thanks to all.</p>

<p>And finally, thanks to the mono project for accept my application and to
Google for the Summer of Code.</p>
