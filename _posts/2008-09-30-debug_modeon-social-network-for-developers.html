<p>Several days ago, we and some old colleagues created the debug_mode=ON
project.  Please, let me post the announcement:</p>

<p>I’m happy to announce the creation of a social network in Spanish for
developers, the web is <a href="http://www.debugmodeon.com">http://debugmodeon.com</a>. For the
moment you can write articles, rate them, comment an article and create groups,
each group has a forum and the articles can be associated with the groups.</p>

<p>The user is the most important in our portal, for this reason a user can <a
	href="http://debugmodeon.com/item/5674/como-anadir-adsense-a-tus-articulos"><strong>earn
		money</strong></a> publishing articles, you only need your
Google Adsense id.</p>

<p>We have created <a href="http://www.debugmodeon.com">debug_mode=ON</a> based on the idea of the ton of different technologies that a developer can learn today. So, a user can creates articles about <a href="http://debugmodeon.com/group/mono">Mono</a> or Cobol, about <a href="http://debugmodeon.com/group/metodologias-agiles">Agile methodologies</a>, SEO, design patterns, or how to do anything. The groups were created with the idea of debate around a concrete subject or a general one (depending the group) all around the them of computers.</p>

<p>To do the site we used Python, it’s running on the service <a href="http://appengine.google.com/">Google App Engine</a>. We licensed our code under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License">Affero GPL</a>, so our code is Open Source.</p>

<p>debug_mode=ON is a beta version, we’ve opened a thread to get your feedback, ¡all the opinions are welcome!.</p>

<p>You can read the offical announce <a href="http://debugmodeon.com/item/16489/que-es-debug-mode-on">here</a>.</p>
