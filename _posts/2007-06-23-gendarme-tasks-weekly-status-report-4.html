<h1>This is the status report for June 18 - June 23</h1>

<h2>Accomplished this week:</h2>

<p>This week I have continued with the Code Duplicated smell.  I'm trying detect
duplicated code reading IL instructions and checking against others.  Is a
simple approach and I can detect some code duplicate.  I'm also impressed with
Cecil, it's a great library and I love the Visitor pattern.</p>

<p>But I'm not happy with the results, because detecting branches is difficult
and I can't detect all code ways.</p>

<p>By example:  Suppose a simple if statement:</p>

{% highlight csharp %}
if (myList.Contains ("MoreFoo"))
        myList.Remove ("MoreFoo");
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The IL Code generated is the following:</p>

{% highlight text %}
IL_0000:  ldarg.0
IL_0001:  ldfld class [mscorlib]System.Collections.IList Test.Rules.Smells.ClassWithCodeDuplicated::myList
IL_0006:  ldstr "MoreFoo"
IL_000b:  callvirt instance bool class [mscorlib]System.Collections.IList::Contains(object)
IL_0010:  brfalse IL_0025

IL_0015:  ldarg.0
IL_0016:  ldfld class [mscorlib]System.Collections.IList Test.Rules.Smells.ClassWithCodeDuplicated::myList
IL_001b:  ldstr "MoreFoo"
IL_0020:  callvirt instance void class [mscorlib]System.Collections.IList::Remove(object)
IL_0025:  ret
{% endhighlight %}

<p>I drop out the ldarg, ldfld, ldstr and others, and I get the information for
compare Instruction Pairs.  And If I write only:</p>

{% highlight csharp %}
myList.Contains ("MoreFoo");
myList.Remove ("MoreFoo");
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The unique difference in the IL code was that I haven't the branch
instruction.  I can detect simple duplications, but only detecting these ones
won't be useful.</p>

<p>Then I decided:</p>

<h2>Plans for the next week.</h2>

<p>Following the last lines, I have decided change the code representation, and
I will use Control Flow Graphs for make some FlowAnalysis and obtain more
information for detect code complete.</p>

<p>I can get from the CFG the blocks and check blocks.  And better, I can try
detect common subsets for each block.  With this approach I believe that I can
write a more complete analysis and detect the code duplication better and in a
easier way.</p>

<h2>Challenges or Problems.</h2>

<p>Yes, a lot !  For the first, I have decide use the Cecil.FlowAnalysis
assembly (placed in the cecil module in mono svn) for obtain the CFG, I will
save a lot of work using this library.  But I have a little trouble.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon,  I started working on the CFG analysis, then I started
building the graphs; and I get a surprise:</p>

{% highlight text %}
1) Test.Rules.Smells.DetectCodeDuplicatedInSameClassTest.TestClassWithCodeDuplicated : System.ArgumentException : Exception handlers are not supported.
Parameter name: body
  at Cecil.FlowAnalysis.Impl.ControlFlow.FlowGraphBuilder..ctor (Mono.Cecil.MethodDefinition method) [0x00000]

  at Gendarme.Rules.Smells.DetectCodeDuplicatedInSameClassRule.ContainsDuplicatedCode (Mono.Cecil.MethodDefinition currentMethod, Mono.Cecil.MethodDefinition targetMethod) [0x00000] 
  at Gendarme.Rules.Smells.DetectCodeDuplicatedInSameClassRule.CheckType (Mono.Cecil.TypeDefinition typeDefinition, Gendarme.Framework.Runner runner) [0x00000] 
  at Test.Rules.Smells.DetectCodeDuplicatedInSameClassTest.TestClassWithCodeDuplicated () [0x00000] 
  at &lt;0x00000> <unknown method>
  at (wrapper managed-to-native) System.Reflection.MonoMethod:InternalInvoke (object,object[])
  at System.Reflection.MonoMethod.Invoke (System.Object obj, BindingFlags invokeAttr, System.Reflection.Binder binder, System.Object[] parameters, System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture) [0x00000] 
  </unknown>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Ouch !  Then I believe that I have to write a patch for allow exception
handlers and build the graph.</p>

<h2>Interesting resources.</h2>

<p>This week, I only have an interesting resource that hope helps me with this
work, the dragon's book :)</p>

<p>Finally thanks to <a href="http://pages.infinit.net/ctech/poupou.html">Sebastien</a> for solve my doubts.  Also thanks to all mono people, every day I enjoy a bit more working with this great people.</p>
<p>I want also congratulate the Moonlight accomplishmet, I want try this
technology!</p>
