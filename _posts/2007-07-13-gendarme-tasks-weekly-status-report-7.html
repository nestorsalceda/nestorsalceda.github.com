<h1>This is the status report for July 9 - July 13.</h1>

<h2>Accomplished this week.</h2>

<p>This week, I have quasi finished the rule for detect long methods.  Well, the
rule simply count the IL instructions and compare with a MaxInstructions value.
The big challenge for this rule has been choose the MaxInstruction value, this
is because if you choose a little value you will get a lot of rule violations,
and else if you choose a big value you won't get any violation.  The two
situations are useless.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://gameweld-soc.blogspot.com/">Chris Gameweld</a> suggested
me, I have to take care of the autogenerated methods too.  The first approach
try to find autogenerated methods simply if the IL code doesn't contain cond
branches instructions.  But this pattern isn't always true, by example Stetic
generate a if statement.  Then, I have collected some well known autogenerated
method names, and checking them (and their types) I can know if a method is
autogenerated.</p>

<p>I only have to check the types, and I will get the rule ready for the
reviewing.</p>

<p>I also have proposed a new rule for a new smell.  The rule is Detect Long
Parameter List. The rule should check if a method contains a lot of parameters,
and the big challenge will be (also) choose the value for the parameter
numbers.</p>

<h2>Plans for the next week.</h2>

<p>Well, I have to finish the rules and go forward with more smells.  I haven't
decided yet what will be the next smell.</p>

<h2>Challenges or problems.</h2>

<p>None, for measure the methods I have chosen a little bit more of a screen.  I
have get the magic number rounding up to 170 IL instructions.</p>

<p>I have to get the upper limit for the long parameter list.  But this time, I
will measure and compare the results with some software metrics, because IMHO I
can get better conclusions.</p>

<h2>Interesting resources.</h2>

<p>I have the same resources that the last week.</p>

<p>I want to thank to Lukasz Knop and to <a href="http://gameweld-soc.blogspot.com/">Chris Gameweld</a> that suggest me measures, and some corner cases.</p>
