<p>Well, last week I have spent some time learning Cecil and Gendarme stuff.
I've written my first draft for checking a simple rule and achieve some
knowledge about these two technologies.  I really enjoyed a lot learning these
technologies.</p>

<p>I'm going to say my first impressions for each techonlogy.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Gendarme is simple.  Writting new rules is easy.  You only have to implement an interface.</li>
	<li>Gendarme is well named.  If you want to create a new rule for check types, you will implement the ITypeRule interface.  If you want to create a new rule for check methods, you will implement the IMethodRule interface.</li>
	<li>Gendarme isn't intrusive and is powerful. You can write the rule that you want.  You can write simple rules, and also, you can write really complex rules.</li>
	<li>Gendarme is integrated.  You can use gendarme with different development tools (you can create a NAnt task, you can use with Makefiles) and programming language (you can use VB.NET, you can use Boo).</li>
	<li>And finally, Gendarme is in continous improvement.</li>
</ul>

<p>I also think Cecil is a great framework too.  By this moment, I think it's
simple, it's fast and it's easy deal with it and you have a lot of
documentation.  I can't write more about Cecil, because Cecil is bigger an I
will need more time to learn it.</p>

<p>Well, the first rule that I've chosen to implement is that Attributes ends with "Attribute" suffix.</p>

<p>This rule will check that the new attributes ends with "Attribute" suffix.  You can see the reference in <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/docs/index.aspx?link=ecmaspec%3a24.1">C#Language Specification</a>.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<p>Good:</p>
{% highlight csharp %}
public class CustomAttribute : Attribute {
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Bad:</p>
{% highlight csharp %}
public class Custom : Attribute {
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>In the next days, I will add more test cases and I will put some links to
source code to prove that it's really easy write this rules with Gendarme and
Cecil.</p>
