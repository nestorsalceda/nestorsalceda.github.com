<p> It was a lot of time since I blogged for the last time, and I should write some
news:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gendarme has reached the 0.2 release.  You can read the <a href="http://pages.infinit.net/ctech/20080716-1115.html">release notes</a> if you want more information.</li>
<li>I have passed the mid-term evaluation and I will continue adding rules, fixes, trimming down false positives ... </li>
<li>I'm generating with more or less frequence, some gendarme reports applied to the base class library and for other mono tools.  This help me (I hope others too) for write new rules and for trimming down false positives.  When I start to publish them daily I will put the link here :)</li>
</ul>
