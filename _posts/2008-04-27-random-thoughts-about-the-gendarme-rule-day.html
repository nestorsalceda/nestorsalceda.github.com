<p>Well, I'm proud to say that the first edition of the Gendarme Rule Day has
been a great experience and it ended successfully.</p>

<p>Also give a <strong>big thank</strong> to all people that was yesterday in
the IRC with us (you rocks dudes!).  Thanks for your time, thanks for your
ideas, thanks for your presence, thanks for the thanks, thanks for the laughings
... thanks for all.</p>

<h3>Numbers:</h3>

<p>In this edition, if my review doesn't fail, we have 10 more rules and 3 nice enhacements to existing rules.  And a lot of new ideas for great features.  And also we have new friends and 2 new rule makers: Cedric Vivier and <a href="http://knocte.blogspot.com/">Andr√©s</a>.</p>

<h3>Next steps:</h3>

<p> Well, by myself, I should start finishing several tasks I had started in the past:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gendarme and NAnt integration</li>
<li>Message Chains Smell </li>
<li>A new way to express custom parameters to the rules in the XML file</li>
</ul>

<p>And for finishing, I'm proud of being part of the <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Gendarme">Gendarme</a> Team, thanks mates for the <a href="http://pages.infinit.net/ctech/20080425-0920.html">reminders</a>, thanks for your help planning, giving nice tips, staying there and writting <a href="http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/viewcvs/trunk/mono-tools/gendarme/rules/Gendarme.Rules.Performance/UseTypeEmptyTypesRule.cs?view=markup"> new</a> rules.  All I can to say is that we can't stop rocking ;)</p>
