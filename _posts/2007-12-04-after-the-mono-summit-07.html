<p>Wonderful, incredible, fantastic, amazing... I haven't enough words for
describing my first Mono Summit.</p>

<p>The first day, I was really excited and a bit nervous because I didn't know anyone, but quickly I found <a href="http://pages.infinit.net/ctech/poupou.html">Sebastien</a> and <a href="http://evain.net/blog/">JB</a> and I sat by them (thanks you for
all guys!) and we started talking, and hacking.</p>

<p>I also can see other people from the Mono-Hispano community (Andres, Carlos, Juan Ramon ...) but I missed <a href="http://straybirds130.blogspot.com/">Marcos</a> a mate from the
GSoC, I didn't meet you, but I hope the next time we will meet.</p>

<p>All talks also was really interesting: MonoDevelop, NUnit, Boo, Db4o, C# 3.0,
Moonlight, Build Service, Boxerp, Debugger ...</p>

<p>Summarizing, the best: all the people.  Thanks you very much!</p>

<p>Finally the last day, we discussed the new features for the next Gendarme release, you can see it <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/gendarme/web/roadmap">here</a>.
There are some killer features and a lot of new ideas.</p>
