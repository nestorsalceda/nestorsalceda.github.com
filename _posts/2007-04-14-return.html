<p>Yes,  I'm returning.</>

<p>I'm going to talk a little about me.  My name is NÃ©stor Salceda and I'm
finishing my computer science studies.  I'm interested in software engineering:
concretely about refactoring, software testing, design by contract, compiler
design and implementation and component software.</p>

<p>I have had other blog, but  my local home server crashed some time ago.  My last <a href="http://wizito.is-a-geek.net">weblog address</a> is invalid.  This will be my new blog site, special thanks to <a href="http://www.sergiorubio.net">Sergio Rubio</a>, my dear
Sysadmin.</p>

<p>In this blog I'm going to talk about my <a href="http://code.google.com/soc">Google Summer of Code</a> project.  I'm going to write some <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Gendarme">Gendarme Rules</a> for detect bad smells into the code.  I may also write about others OSS stuff that I'm writing, for exmple the <a href="http://www.babuine.net">Babuine Component Model</a>, this is a framework for develop MVC components quickly with Mono.</p>

<p>The smell concept is amazing, when I was reading the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201485672"> Martin Fowler's book called Refactoring</a>.  The smells really impressed me. I will write other rules too.</p>

<p>Okey, the last one; as <a href="http://themonkeysgrinder.blogspot.com/2007/04/it-begins.html"/>Scott Peterson</a> do, I'm going to post a photo of me.</p>

<a href="/images/nestor_small.jpg"><img src='/images/nestor_small.jpg' width="100%" alt='Photo of me' /></a>

<p>Well, good luck for all the students that will write the SOC applications.
And thanks to mono project for the chance.</p>
