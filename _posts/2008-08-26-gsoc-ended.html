Well, a week has passed since the Summer of Code 2008 finished and I haven't
wrote anything yet mainly because I took some holidays :)  Now, with my fully
charged batteries I can write a little summary and show some stuff I've
done.</p>

<p>I will start by the beginning :P</p>

<p>There are new rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Avoid Calling Problematic Methods [IN TRUNK]</li>
	<li>Attribute String Literals Should Parse Correctly [IN TRUNK]</li>
	<li>Provide Correct Arguments To Formatting Methods [IN TRUNK]</li>
	<li>Declare Event Handlers Correctly</li>
	<li>Instantiate Argument Exception Correctly [IN TRUNK]</li>
	<li>Call Base Methods On ISerializable Types [IN TRUNK]</li>
	<li>Implement ISerializable Correctly [IN TRUNK]</li>
	<li>Mark All NonSerializable Fields [IN TRUNK]</li>
</ul>

<p> There are 7 new rules in the SVN and the other is in the mono-soc-2008 svn,
because I want review it in order to avoid false positives and commit code that
works :) Almost of them, are rules which deals with the implementation and I
think they are more useful to the other mono developers.</p>

<p>In the second place, I should say something about the reporter.</p>

<p>The reporter is a tool which takes the gendarme reports, in xml format.  The
report is passed to a pipeline (you can write your own!) and the pipeline
applies some actions (you can write your owns too!) to the input and the input
is transformed to other documents.  Let me show you an example:</p>

<p>You runs gendarme against the corlib, then a report file is generated.  You
take the reporter and can generate a master index report or you can filter the
defects per severity or ...</p>

<p>And in the third place, I automated the report generation and publication with a little bash script (which needs a bit more of love).  The script runs gendarme, and pass the output to the report and I publish the results (more or less) frequently, and you can see a little example in: <a href="http://www.babuine.net/gendarme-reports/2.0-reports/08-18-2008/classlib/master-index.xml">The classlib</a> and <a href="http://www.babuine.net/gendarme-reports/2.0-reports/08-18-2008/tools/master-index.xml">the tools</a>.  It's a great chance for the newcomers for getting involved in the mono development :)</p>

<p>And this week is the Novell's Hack Week, and I hope get some time in order to talk and code with <a href="http://pages.infinit.net/ctech/poupou.html">Sebastien</a>, and I'm sure we will have more cool news :)</p>

<p>Hope you like all the news!</p>
