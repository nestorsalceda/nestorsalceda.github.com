<h1>This is the status report for August 6 - August 12.</h1>

<h2>Accomplished this week.</h2>

<p>Well, this week I have posted the rule for detect large classes, I have
written it and I have posted for the reviewing.</p>

<h2>Plans for the next week.</h2>

<p>The next week I would like continue writting more smells, but I don't know
which smell will be the following.</p>

<h2>Challenges or problems.</h2>

<p>This week, <a href="http://pages.infinit.net/ctech/poupou.html">Sebastien</a>
and <a href="http://gameweld-soc.blogspot.com/">Chris</a> advice me about the
similarities among smells.   By example:  If you have a large class then the
probability of that class contains code duplicated is greater, then you can have
a violation for the large class and other violation for the code
duplication.</p>

<p>Then the challenge will be determine how I can make sure I report the best /
right rule violation.  This problem is hard to solve, then I will think about
it.</p>

<h2>Interesting resources.</h2>

<p>Yesterday, I saw an e-mail from <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/index.html">Miguel</a>, with a really interesting blog, here is the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/fxcop/default.aspx">link</a>.</p>

<p>And, that's all.  Thanks to the people who has write comments to the
rules.</p>
