<p>Google Summer of Code started the previous week, I can't believe I haven't
blogged anything yet about the topic.</p>

<p>Let me talk a little about me,  my name is NÃ©stor Salceda and I'm studying
Computer Science and, perhaps, someone will known me yet because this is my
second year as student in the Summer of Code, the first year was wonderful and I
decided apply other time :)</p>

<p>This year, my goal is to enhace <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Gendarme">Gendarme</a> in order to be more useful to the <a href="http://www.mono-project.com">Mono Project</a> itself.  For achieving this goal I have identified 4 key tasks:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Apply the existing rules.</li>
	<li>Write new rules, putting special effort in write useful rules for implementing the class libraries.</li>
	<li>Apply the new rules to the class libraries.</li>
	<li>Automated Gendarme Reports generation and publication.</li>
</ul>

<p>And finally, good luck for all students, and thanks to Mono Project for the opportunity :)</p>
