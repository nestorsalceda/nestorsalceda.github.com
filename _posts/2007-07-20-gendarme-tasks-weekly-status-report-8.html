<h1>This is the status report for July 16 - July 20.</h1>

<h2>Accomplished this week.</h2>

<p>With a little bit of delayment, I have written a little cecil based tool for
measure the methods and the types.  I need this tool for choose the values for
detect long parameter lists.</p>

<p>Currently the tool takes measures from types and methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>For Types:  Lines per method, parameters per method, maximum lines in a method and maximum parameters in a method.</li>
<li>For Methods: Lines in a method and number of parameters.</li>
</ul>

<p>I will post a screencast on Monday.</p>

<h2>Plans for the next week.</h2>

<p>I hope finish the current rule (Detect Long Parameter List) and I will
continue with other smells.</p>

<h2>Challenges or Problems.</h2>

<p>None, this is a simple application.  But, if anyone wants suggest me more
interesting measures, I will be glad to read and implement them.</p>

<h2>Interesting resources.</h2>

<p>None, this week I have spent the time writting the application.</p>
